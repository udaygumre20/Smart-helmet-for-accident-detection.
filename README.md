# Smart-helmet-for-accident-detection.

📌 Project Overview
Smart Helmet is an Arduino UNO based safety system designed to improve rider safety by detecting accidents and alcohol consumption.
The system continuously monitors helmet usage and rider condition using sensors and triggers alerts in case of unsafe situations.
This project is suitable for college projects, IoT demonstrations, and safety-based applications.

🎯 Problem Statement
Road accidents are one of the major causes of injuries and deaths.
Many accidents occur due to:
Riding under the influence of alcohol
Delay in accident detection and response
There is a need for a smart, low-cost helmet system that can detect such conditions and help improve road safety.

💡 Proposed Solution

The Smart Helmet uses:
IR Sensor for accident detection
MQ-3 Sensor for alcohol detection
Arduino UNO as the main controller.
If alcohol is detected or an accident occurs, the system triggers alerts (buzzer / signal), helping prevent unsafe riding or enabling faster response.

🧰 Components Used

Arduino UNO,
IR Sensor,
MQ-3 Alcohol Sensor,
Buzzer,
Power Supply,
Connecting Wires,
Helmet (for setup).

⚙️ Working Principle

1.The MQ-3 sensor continuously checks alcohol presence near the rider.

2.If alcohol is detected beyond the threshold.

3.The system identifies unsafe riding condition.

4.The IR sensor detects sudden impact or abnormal position.

5.If an accident is detected.

6.An alert signal is triggered.

7.Arduino UNO processes sensor data and controls the output.
